# How to Download and Install Aldus PageMaker 5.0 for Windows 7
 
Aldus PageMaker, later Adobe PageMaker, is a desktop publishing program for Mac and Windows. First released in 1985, PageMaker was the first desktop publishing program for the Macintosh. It was followed over a year later with the release of 1.0 for the IBM PC. The PC version was a notable application as it was one of the few rare applications which would run under Windows 1.x. PC PageMaker 1.0 bundled a runtime version of Windows. This enabled MS-DOS users who had not decided to buy Windows to run PageMaker[^1^].

Aldus PageMaker 5.0 was released in 1993 for both Mac and Windows platforms. It introduced new features such as color separations, master pages, layers, and improved graphics support[^1^]. It also supported PDF files, which made it easier to share documents across different devices[^2^]. Aldus PageMaker 5.0 was a popular and powerful tool for creating various types of content such as reports, posters, flyers, brochures, books, magazines, and more.
 
However, Aldus PageMaker 5.0 is not compatible with modern versions of Windows such as Windows 7 or later. It was designed to run on Windows 3.x or earlier, which used a different architecture and system resources than newer versions of Windows. Therefore, if you want to use Aldus PageMaker 5.0 on Windows 7, you will need to use an emulator or a virtual machine that can run older versions of Windows.
 
An emulator is a software program that mimics the behavior of another system or device. A virtual machine is a software program that creates a separate environment within your computer that can run another operating system or software. Both methods allow you to run older software that is not compatible with your current system.

3. Create a folder on your computer where you want to install Aldus PageMaker 5.0. For example, you can create a folder called C:\PAGEMAKER.
4. Extract the downloaded installation files to the folder you created in step 3.
5. Launch DOSBox and type the following commands in the DOS prompt:
